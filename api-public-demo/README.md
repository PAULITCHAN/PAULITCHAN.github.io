Rick & Morty Explorer

This small demo fetches character data from the free Rick and Morty public API and displays responsive cards using Bootstrap.

Files
- index.html — main responsive page
- style.css — small visual tweaks
- script.js — fetch + render logic

Deploy as GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository named `YOURUSERNAME.github.io` on GitHub (replace `YOURUSERNAME`).
2. From this project folder (`api-site`) run:

```powershell
# initialize, commit, and push to your GitHub Pages repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add Rick & Morty Explorer"
# replace URL with your repo URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOURUSERNAME.github.io.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Once pushed, GitHub Pages will serve the site at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/`.

If you want, I can attempt to run these git commands and push if your environment already has git and credentials configured—tell me to proceed.
